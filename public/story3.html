        A shoemaker, by no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he had nothing left but leather for one
        pair of shoes. So in the evening, he cut out the shoes which he wished to begin to make the next morning, and as
        he had a good conscience, he lay down quietly in his bed, commended himself to God, and fell asleep. In the
        morning, after he had said his prayers, and was just going to sit down to work, the two shoes stood quite
        finished on his table. He was astounded, and knew not what to say to it. He took the shoes in his hands to
        observe them closer, and they were so neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them, just as if they
        were intended as a masterpiece. Soon after, a buyer came in, and as the shoes pleased him so well, he paid more
        for them than was customary, and, with the money, the shoemaker was able to purchase leather for two pairs of
        shoes. He cut them out at night, and next morning was about to set to work with fresh courage; but he had no
        need to do so, for, when he got up, they were already made, and buyers also were not wanting, who gave him money
        enough to buy leather for four pairs of shoes. The following morning, too, he found the four pairs made; and so
        it went on constantly, what he cut out in the evening was finished by the morning, so that he soon had his
        honest independence again, and at last became a wealthy man. Now it befell that one evening not long before
        Christmas, when the man had been cutting out, he said to his wife, before going to bed, "What think you if we
        were to stay up to-night to see who it is that lends us this helping hand?" The woman liked the idea, and
        lighted a candle, and then they hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind some clothes which were hanging
        up there, and watched. When it was midnight, two pretty little naked men came, sat down by the shoemaker's
        table, took all the work which was cut out before them and began to stitch, and sew, and hammer so skilfully and
        so quickly with their little fingers that the shoemaker could not turn away his eyes for astonishment. They did
        not stop until all was done, and stood finished on the table, and they ran quickly away.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Next morning the woman said, "The little men have made us rich, and we really must show that we are grateful for
        it. They run about so, and have nothing on, and must be cold. I'll tell thee what I'll do: I will make them
        little shirts, and coats, and vests, and trousers, and knit both of them a pair of stockings, and do thou, too,
        make them two little pairs of shoes." The man said, "I shall be very glad to do it;" and one night, when
        everything was ready, they laid their presents all together on the table instead of the cut-out work, and then
        concealed themselves to see how the little men would behave. At midnight they came bounding in, and wanted to
        get to work at once, but as they did not find any leather cut out, but only the pretty little articles of
        clothing, they were at first astonished, and then they showed intense delight. They dressed themselves with the
        greatest rapidity, putting the pretty clothes on, and singing,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now we are boys so fine to see, <br>
        Why should we longer cobblers be?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Then they danced and skipped and leapt over chairs and benches. At last they danced out of doors. From that time
        forth they came no more, but as long as the shoemaker lived all went well with him, and all his undertakings
        prospered.
