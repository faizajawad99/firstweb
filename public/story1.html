        David Bowie was arguably one of the greatest creatives of the past 50 years. By the time he died, in 2016, he
        produced no fewer than 36 albums and more than 100 singles. He acted in a few dozen films and exhibited his
        paintings widely in museums and galleries. He co-wrote a Broadway show and developed an internet platform for
        creative content called BowieNet. He invented the Verbasizer, a sentence randomizer app for writing lyrics. By
        any
        standard, Bowie was wildly successful, both artistically and commercially. As a cultural icon, he achieved more
        than mere fame.

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>His singular life was studded with innovation, and he practically invented reinvention. Where someone else
        might
        have rested in the glam-rock Ziggy Stardust glory days, Bowie zagged with Diamond Dogs and then Young Americans.
        After that foray into soul, he left for Europe and experimental electronic music. Friend and collaborator Brian
        Eno explained Bowie’s fearless shape-shifting as a way to “duck the momentum of a successful career” and keep
        his
        work fresh and interesting, for himself as much as for his audience. No doubt that one crucial common
        denominator
        — creating for himself, an audience of one — is what made Bowie a vital, timely, authentic artist right up until
        his death.

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>If you’re in pursuit of pleasing others, it’s easy to forget exactly why you initially started working on a
        creative endeavor. Bowie did not forget, saying:</p>
      <br>
        <q style="background-color: aquamarine;">

        Never play to the gallery. Never work for other people in what you do. Always remember that the reason you
        initially started working was there was something inside yourself that, if you could manifest it, you felt you
        would understand more about yourself. I think it’s terribly dangerous for an artist to fulfill other people’s
        expectations.
      </q>
      <br>
      <p>Attempting to fulfill other people’s expectations is a fool’s errand when it comes to creative work. It’s
        inevitable that you will fail on some level, make compromises you regret, and end up with your worst work. You
        may or may not find acclaim, but you’ll be pretty miserable as a creative if you don’t follow your heart. Bowie
        not only believed that—he embodied what it means.

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The ultimate paradox of creative work is that what you create for an audience of one is much more likely to
        reach an audience of millions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1><b>Creating for an Audience of One</b></h1>
      <p>
        Many creators dream of the day when millions of people will listen to their shows, read their books, buy their
        products, or watch them perform. But what will you bring to the table when you’re performing only for an
        audience of one — yourself?
