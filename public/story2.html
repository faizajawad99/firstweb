        MIDWAY upon the journey of our life 1
        <br>
        I found myself within a forest dark, 2
        <br>
        
        For the straightforward pathway had been lost. <br>
        Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say <br>
        What was this forest savage, rough, and stern, <br>
        Which in the very thought renews the fear. <br>
        <br>
        So bitter is it, death is little more; <br>
        But of the good to treat, which there I found, <br>
        Speak will I of the other things I saw there. <br>
        <br>
        I cannot well repeat how there I entered, <br>
        So full was I of slumber at the moment <br>
        In which I had abandoned the true way. <br>
        <br>
        But after I had reached a mountain’s foot, 3 <br>
        At that point where the valley terminated, 4 <br>
        <br>
        Which had with consternation pierced my heart, <br>
        Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders <br>
        <br>
        _________________________________

        1The action of the poem begins on Good Friday of the year 1300, at which time Dante, <br>
        who was born in 1265, had reached the middle of the Scriptual threescore years and ten. <br>
        It ends on the first Sunday after Easter, making in all ten days. <br>
        2The dark forest of human life, with its passions, vices, and perplexities of all kinds;<br>
        politically the state of Florence with its fractions Guelf and Ghibelline. <br>
        3Bunyan, in his Pilgrim’s Progress, which is a kind of Divine Comedy in prose, says: “I <br>
        beheld then that they all went on till they came to the foot of the hill Difficulty... But the <br>
        narrow way lay right up the hill, and the name of the going up the side of the hill is called <br>
        Difficulty... They went then till they came to the Delectable Mountains, which mountains<br>
        belong to the Lord of that hill of which we have spoken before.”<br>
        4Bunyan, Pilgrim’s Progress – “But now in this valley of Humiliation poor Christian<br>
        was hard put to it; for he had gone but a little way before he spied a foul fiend coming<br>
        over the field to meet him; his name is Apollyon. Then did Christian begin to be afraid,<br>
        and to cast in his mind whether to go back or stand his ground. ...Now at the end of this<br>
        valley was another, called the valley of the Shadow of Death; and Christian must needs<br>
        go through it, because the way to the Celestial City lay through the midst of it.” </p>
        <br>
        <br>
      <p>
        Vested already with that planet’s rays 5 <br>
        Which leadeth others right by every road. <br>
        Then was the fear a little quieted <br>
        That in my heart’s lake had endured throughout 6 <br>
        The night, which I had passed so piteously <br>
        And even as he, who, with distressful breath, <br>
        Forth issued from the sea upon the shore, <br>
        Turns to the water perilous and gazes; <br>
        So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward, <br>
        Turn itself back to re-behold the pass <br>
        Which never yet a living person left. 7 <br>
      <p>
        After my weary body I had rested,<br>
        The way resumed I on the desert slope,<br>
        So that the firm foot ever was the lower. 8<br>
      </p>
      And lo! almost where the ascent began, 9<br>
      A panther light and swift exceedingly, 10<br>
      <p>
        Which with a spotted skin was covered o’er!<br>
        And never moved she from before my face,<br>
        Nay, rather did impede so much my way,<br>
        That many times I to return had turned. 11<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The time was the beginning of the morning,<br>
        And up the sun was mounting with those stars 12<br>
        That with him were, what time the Love Divine<br>
